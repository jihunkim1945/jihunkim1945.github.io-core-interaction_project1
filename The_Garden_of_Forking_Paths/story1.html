              <p>
…And I hung up the phone. Immediately I recognized the voice that had spoken in German.  
It was Captain Richard Madden. His presence in Runeberg’s office meant the end of our work —  
and perhaps the end of our lives.
</p>

<p>
Before the sun set on this same day, I ran the same risk. Madden was implacable.  
An Irishman in the service of England, suspected of treachery — how could he fail  
to seize this extraordinary luck: the capture of two agents of Imperial Germany?
</p>

<p>
I went to my bedroom, locked the door, and lay on the iron bed.  
The rooftops filled the window. The hazy six o’clock sun hung motionless.  
It seemed impossible that this ordinary day might be my last.
</p>

<p>
Then I reflected that all things happen only in the present.  
There are countless men in the world, yet what happens happens to me.  
The memory of Madden’s long face ended these thoughts.
</p>

<p>
In the midst of terror, I knew I possessed the Secret —  
the exact site of the new British artillery park.  
If only my voice could shout the name before I was silenced.
</p>

<p>
In ten minutes I developed my plan.  
The telephone directory gave me the name of the one person capable  
of passing on the information. He lived in Ashgrove.
</p>

<p>
Silently I dressed, left the house, and went to the station.  
The train would leave at eight-fifty. I hurried.  
There was almost no one on the platform.
</p>

<p>
At last the train pulled out.  
A man I recognized ran along the platform.  
It was Captain Richard Madden.
</p>

<p>
The train crept through ash trees and stopped in a field.  
“Ashgrove?” I asked.  
“Ashgrove,” they replied.  
I got out.

             <p>
From utter terror I passed into a kind of miserable happiness.  
The duel had begun; I had won the first encounter — by an accident of timetables.  
Such a victory, small as it was, felt like an omen.
</p>

<p>
I argued with myself: if the schedule had not favored me, I would already be dead.  
If the train had not left at eight-fifty, I would be in prison.  
I knew I was reasoning sophistically — and yet the sophism strengthened me.
</p>

<p>
There are men who resign themselves, day after day, to new abominations.  
Soon only soldiers and bandits will remain.  
Whoever undertakes an atrocious enterprise, I told myself, must act as if it were already accomplished,  
must impose upon himself a future as irrevocable as the past.
</p>

<p>
The train crept along gently amid ash trees.  
It slowed, it stopped, almost in the middle of a field.  
No one called the name of a station.  
“Ashgrove?” I asked the children.  
“Ashgrove,” they replied. I got out.
</p>

<p>
A lamp lit the platform, but their faces were still in shadow.  
One asked if I was going to Dr. Stephen Albert’s house.  
Without waiting for my answer, another spoke as if reciting a rule:  
the house is far, but you will not get lost if you take the road to the left  
and bear to the left at every crossroad.
</p>

<p>
I threw them my last coin and went down the steps into a deserted road.  
At a slight incline it ran downhill.  
Overhead the branches intermingled; the round moon hung low, as if to keep me company.  
The evening was at once intimate and infinite.
</p>

<p>
For a moment I suspected that Madden might have divined my desperate intent.  
At once I realized it was impossible.  
Yet the advice — always to the left — reminded me of the formula for reaching the center of certain labyrinths.  
I know something about labyrinths.
</p>

<p>
Not for nothing am I the great-grandson of Ts’ui Pen.  
He was Governor of Yunnan and gave up temporal power  
to write a novel with more characters than there are in the Hung Lou Meng,  
and to create a maze in which all men would lose themselves.
</p>

<p>
He spent thirteen years on those oddly assorted tasks  
before he was assassinated by a stranger.  
His novel had no sense to it, and nobody ever found his labyrinth.  
Under the trees of England I meditated on this lost and perhaps mythical design.
</p>

<p>
I imagined it untouched and perfect on the secret summit of some mountain;  
I imagined it drowned under rice paddies or beneath the sea.  
I imagined it infinite — not only of pavilions and twisting paths,  
but of rivers, provinces, and kingdoms.  
A maze of mazes, ever growing, taking in both past and future.
</p>

<p>
Lost in these imaginary illusions, I forgot my destiny — that of the hunted.  
For an undetermined time I felt myself cut off from the world, an abstract spectator.  
The countryside murmured; the moon followed; the night approached.  
I went on, without fatigue.

              <p>
When we reached the house we went into a library filled with books from both East and West. I recognized volumes bound in yellow silk, manuscripts of the Lost Encyclopedia, never printed. A phonograph record was spinning near a bronze phoenix. I remember also a rose-glazed jar and another older by centuries, of that blue our potters copied from the Persians.
</p>

<p>
Stephen Albert watched me with a faint smile. He was remarkably tall. His face was deeply lined, his eyes gray, his beard gray. There was about him something of the priest and something of the sailor. Later he told me he had been a missionary before aspiring to become a sinologist.
</p>

<p>
We sat down. I calculated that my pursuer could not arrive in less than an hour. My irrevocable decision could wait. “A strange destiny,” said Albert, “that of Ts’ui Pen. Governor, astronomer, poet, calligrapher—yet he abandoned everything to write a book and build a labyrinth.”
</p>

<p>
He gave up power, banquets, justice, erudition, and shut himself up for thirteen years. At his death his heirs found only a mess of manuscripts. The family wished to burn them, but the executor insisted on publication.
</p>

<p>
“Those of Ts’ui Pen’s blood still curse that monk,” I replied. “The book is a shapeless mass. In one chapter the hero dies; in the next he lives again. As for the labyrinth…”  
“Here is the labyrinth,” Albert said, pointing to a lacquered cabinet.  
“An ivory labyrinth?”  
“A symbolic labyrinth. An invisible labyrinth of time.”
</p>

<p>
He explained that no one realized the book and the labyrinth were one. Ts’ui Pen did not choose between possible futures—he chose all of them. Each decision creates new times which branch and multiply. Thus the contradictions of the novel are not errors but the structure itself.
</p>

<p>
“In one future you come here as my friend. In another as my enemy. In another I am already dead. Time is a network of diverging, converging, and parallel paths. We do not exist in most of them. In some you exist and not I. In others I exist and not you.”
</p>

<p>
His face, in the circle of lamplight, seemed ancient yet strangely luminous. With slow precision he read two versions of the same battle: in one the soldiers march through a desolate pass and win easily; in the other they march through a palace of splendor and also win. Both occur. All occur.
</p>

<p>
I listened with veneration. Not so much for the tales themselves, but for the fact that they had been imagined by one of my own blood and returned to me in the final stage of a desperate adventure. The night deepened. The garden outside seemed saturated with invisible presences.

“I do not think your ancestor wasted thirteen years on rhetoric,” Albert continued. “He was concerned with the deepest problem of all: time. Yet the word itself never appears in the book. To omit a word completely is perhaps the best way to draw attention to it.”
</p>

<p>
He explained that the novel was an enormous parable whose subject was time itself. A web of diverging and converging possibilities, an ever-growing network of futures. Each moment splits into innumerable paths. Each path contains further divisions. The universe is not a line but a labyrinth.
</p>

<p>
“In this one,” he said, “you have come to my gate. In another you have found me dead. In yet another I am your enemy.”  
“In all of them,” I replied with a tremor, “I am grateful to you for restoring Ts’ui Pen’s garden.”  
“Not in all,” he murmured. “In one of them I am your enemy.”
</p>

<p>
At that moment I sensed something invisible and intangible around us. It was not the movement of armies but an agitation more intimate, more inaccessible. It seemed to me that the garden surrounding the house was filled with countless versions of ourselves, all secretive, all busy, in other dimensions of time.
</p>

<p>
I lifted my eyes. The illusion vanished. In the black and yellow garden there was only a single man. He walked steadily along the path. He was Captain Richard Madden.
</p>

<p>
“The future exists now,” I said. “But I am your friend. May I see the letter again?”  
Albert turned his back to open the drawer. For a moment he stood tall before the cabinet. I had the revolver ready. I fired with the utmost care.
</p>

<p>
Albert fell without a murmur. His death was instantaneous, as if struck by lightning. What remains is unreal. Madden broke in and arrested me. I have been condemned to hang. Yet I have triumphed.
</p>

<p>
The secret name of the city reached Berlin. Yesterday it was bombed. The Chief understood that I had only one way to transmit the name: to kill a man named Albert. He does not know—and no one can know—of my infinite penitence and sickness of the heart.
